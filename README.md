# Credit-Card-Services
Interactive credit card service provider having a range of functions

This simple program uses Luhn's algorithm to simulate a credit card service platform. 
The program can generate a new credit car number based on user preferences. Additionally, it is capable of validating a given credit card number and declaring it as a genuine or a fake. Finally, it can also fill in the missing digits of a given card number whilst being in accordance with the Luhn's algorithm (upto 5 digits) and is useful in the case of forgotten card details.

_This program is solely owned and developed by me. It was created during my final year at high school and only uses Python functions and no external libraries_
